INTRODUCTION                                  *leap* *leap.nvim* *leap-introduction*

Leap is a motion plugin that allows you to jump to any positions in the
visible editor area by entering a 2-character search pattern, and then
potentially a label character to pick your target from multiple matches,
similar to vim-sneak (https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak). The main novel
idea in Leap is that you get a preview of the target labels - Leap shows you
which key you will need to press before you actually need to do that,
resulting in a smoother overall experience.

Key mappings should be defined explicitly. To start using the plugin with the
default ones, call `require('leap').create_default_mappings()`.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                               *leap-usage*

- Initiate the search in the forward (`s`) or backward (`S`) direction, or in
  the other windows (`gs`).
- Start typing a 2-character pattern (`{char1}{char2}`).
- After typing the first character, you see "labels" appearing next to some of
  the `{char1}{?}` pairs. You cannot _use_ the labels yet. *leap-phase-one*
- Enter `{char2}`. If the pair was not labeled, then voilà, you're already
  there. No need to be bothered by remaining labels - those are guaranteed
  "safe" letters, and will disappear on the next keypress -, just continue
  editing. *leap-autojump*
- Else: type the label character. If there are too many matches (more than
  ~50), you might need to switch to the desired group first, using `<space>`
  (step back with `<tab>`, if needed). *leap-phase-two*

                                                *leap-to-eol* *leap-to-empty-line*
A character at the end of a line can be targeted by pressing `<space>` after
it. There is no special mechanism behind this: `<space>` is simply an alias
for the newline character, defined in |leap.opts.equivalence_classes| by
default.

A slightly more magical feature is that you can target actual EOL positions,
including empty lines, by pressing the newline alias twice (`<space><space>`).
This fulfills the principle that any visible position you can move to with the
cursor should be reachable by Leap too.

                                                           *leap-smart-autojump*
Leap only jumps to the first match if the remaining matches can be covered by
a limited set of "safe" target labels (keys you would not use right after a
jump), but stays in place, and switches to an extended label set otherwise.
For fine-tuning or disabling this behaviour, see |leap.opts.labels| and
|leap.opts.safe_labels|.

                                                    *leap-repeat* *leap-traversal*
At any stage (after 0, 1, or 2 input characters), `<enter>`
(|leap.opts.special_keys.next_target|) consistently jumps to the first
available target. Pressing it right after invocation (`s<enter>`) repeats the
previous search. Pressing it after one input character (`s{char}<enter>`) can
be used as a multiline substitute for `fFtT` motions.

If the search is directional, `<enter>` can also traverse through the rest of
the targets, moving on to the next one on each subsequent keypress
(`s<enter><enter>...`). If you overshoot, `<tab>`
(|leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target|) can revert the jump(s).

There is a convenience function in the `user` module to set keys that behave
like |;| and |,|, that is, repeat the last motion without explicitly invoking
Leap (after that, they enter traversal mode, and behave as you would expect).
It makes sense to use `next_target` and `prev_target`, for maximum
consistency: >lua

    require('leap.user').set_repeat_keys('<enter>', '<backspace>', {
      -- False by default. If set to true, the keys will work like the
      -- native semicolon/comma, i.e., forward/backward is understood in
      -- relation to the last motion.
      relative_directions = true,
      -- By default, all modes are included.
      modes = {'n', 'x', 'o'},
    })
<
                                                               *leap-dot-repeat*
Operations can be repeated with |.|, if repeat.vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) is installed.

                                                         *leap-concealed-labels*
In |leap-phase-one|, some labels might be concealed with an empty block or a
middle dot, depending on the colorscheme. Those mark that there is some kind
of conflict or potential source of confusion, that will only be resolved after
entering the second input character:

    A. The label is on top of another label.
    B. The label immediately follows an unlabeled match.
    C. The label is on top of an unlabeled match.
    D. The label is not active yet (it is for a distant match), but no
       highlighting is set for unlabeled matches - in this case, we need to
       signal that this is in fact a labeled match, do not expect an autojump.

Case A and B are possible when the target is right next to EOL or the window
edge, and the label is shifted left.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                         *leap-mappings*

                                                         *leap-default-mappings*
The defaults can be set by calling
`require('leap').create_default_mappings()`.

                                                        *leap_s*
s{char1}{char2}         Jump forward to a labeled or [count]'th visible
                        occurrence of {char1}{char2}. The cursor is placed on
                        {char1} |exclusive|.
                        To operate till the end of the line, use |o_v|, and
                        include the newline characer (aliased to `<space>` by
                        default in |leap.opts.equivalence_classes|) in the
                        input pattern: `{op}vs{char}{newline}`.

                                                        *leap_S*
S{char1}{char2}         Jump backward to a labeled or [count]'th visible
                        occurrence of {char1}{char2}. The cursor is placed on
                        {char1} |exclusive|.

                                                        *leap_gs*
gs{char1}{char2}        Jump to a labeled occurrence of {char1}{char2} in one
                        of the other windows on the tab page. The cursor is
                        placed on {char1} |exclusive|.

                                                          *leap-custom-mappings*
<Plug> keys are aliases for right hand sides of mappings - in our case, calls
to |leap.leap()|. So simply use these strings as `rhs` in |vim.keymap.set()|:
>lua
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'f', '<Plug>(leap-forward)')


Default motions:

*<Plug>(leap-forward)*
arguments: `{}`

*<Plug>(leap-backward)*
arguments: `{ backward = true }`

*<Plug>(leap-from-window)*
arguments: `{ target_windows = require('leap.util').get_enterable_windows() }`

Calling `require('leap').create_default_mappings()` is equivalent to: >lua

    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's',  '<Plug>(leap-forward)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'S',  '<Plug>(leap-backward)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'gs', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')


Bidirectional search in the current window:

*<Plug>(leap)*
arguments: `{ target_windows = { vim.api.nvim_get_current_win() } }`

`<Plug>(leap)` sorts matches by euclidean (beeline) distance from the cursor,
with the exception that the current line, and on the current line, forward
direction is prioritized. That is, you can always be sure that the targets
right in front of you will be the first ones.

Note that you will get twice as many targets and thus half as many autojumps
on average, but not needing to press the Shift key for backward motions might
compensate for that. Another caveat is that you cannot traverse through the
matches (|leap-traversal|), although invoking repeat right away
(|leap-repeat|) can substitute for that.

Suggested arrangement: >lua

    vim.keymap.set('n',        's', '<Plug>(leap)')
    vim.keymap.set('n',        'S', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'}, 's', '<Plug>(leap-forward)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'}, 'S', '<Plug>(leap-backward)')

Mapping to `<Plug>(leap)` is not recommended for Visual mode, as autojumping
in a random direction might be too disorienting with the selection highlight
on, and neither for Operator-pending mode, as dot-repeat cannot be used if the
search is non-directional.


Evil-snipe-style (https://github.com/hlissner/evil-snipe) directional set for
in-window motions (including or excluding the whole 2-character match in
Visual and Operator-pending-mode):

*<Plug>(leap-forward-to)*
arguments: `{}` in Normal mode, otherwise `{ offset = +1, inclusive_op = true }`

*<Plug>(leap-backward-to)*
arguments: `{ backward = true }`

*<Plug>(leap-forward-till)*
arguments: `{ offset = -1, inclusive_op = true }`

*<Plug>(leap-backward-till)*
arguments: `{ backward = true, offset = 2 }`

Suggested arrangement: >lua

    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's',  '<Plug>(leap-forward-to)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'S',  '<Plug>(leap-backward-to)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'},      'x',  '<Plug>(leap-forward-till)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'},      'X',  '<Plug>(leap-backward-till)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'gs', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')


To create custom motions with behaviours different from the predefined ones,
see |leap.leap()|.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                            *leap-config* *leap.opts*

Below is the description of all configurable values in the `opts` table, with
their defaults.

Example configuration: >lua
    local leap = require('leap')
    leap.opts.case_sensitive = true
    leap.opts.substitute_chars = { ['\r'] = '¬' }
    leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target = '<s-enter>'
<
                                                      *leap.opts.case_sensitive*
`case_sensitive = false`

    Consider case in search patterns.

                                                 *leap.opts.equivalence_classes*
`equivalence_classes = { ' \t\r\n' }`

    A character in search patterns will match any other in its equivalence
    class. The sets can either be defined as strings or tables.

    Example - whitespace, brackets, and quotes: >lua
        { ' \t\r\n', '([{', ')]}', '\'"`' }
<
    Note: Make sure to have a set containing `\n` if you want to be able to
    target empty lines and characters at the end of the line.

    Note: Non-mutual aliases are not possible in Leap, for the same reason
    that supporting |smartcase| is not possible: we would need to show two
    different labels, corresponding to two different futures, at the same
    time.

                                               *leap.opts.max_phase_one_targets*
`max_phase_one_targets = nil`

    Number of targets in |leap-phase-one|, above which ahead-of-time
    displaying of target beacons - labels and/or match highlight - will be
    disabled (to mitigate visual noise in extreme cases). `nil` means no
    limit, `0` disables two-phase processing altogether.

                               *leap.opts.highlight_unlabeled_phase_one_targets*
`highlight_unlabeled_phase_one_targets = false`

    Highlight unlabeled (i.e., directly reachable) matches in
    |leap-phase-one|.

                                   *leap.opts.max_highlighted_traversal_targets*
`max_highlighted_traversal_targets = 10`

    Number of targets to be highlighted after the cursor in |leap-traversal|
    mode, if there are no labels used.

                                                    *leap.opts.substitute_chars*
`substitute_chars = {}`

    The keys in this table will be substituted in labels and highlighted
    matches by the given characters. This way special (e.g. whitespace)
    characters can be made visible in matches, or even be used as labels.

    Example: `{ ['\r'] = '¬' }`

                                                         *leap.opts.safe_labels*
`safe_labels = 'sfnut/SFNLHMUGTZ?'`

    When the number of matches does not exceed the number of these "safe"
    labels plus one, the plugin jumps to the first match automatically after
    entering the pattern. Obviously, for this purpose you should choose keys
    that are unlikely to be used right after a jump!

    The list can either be defined as a string or a table. Setting it to `{}`
    or `''` effectively disables the autojump feature.

    Note: Operator-pending mode ignores this, since we need to be able to
    select the actual target before executing the operation.

                                                              *leap.opts.labels*
`labels = 'sfnjklhodweimbuyvrgtaqpcxz/SFNJKLHODWEIMBUYVRGTAQPCXZ?'`

    Target labels to be used when there are more matches than labels in
    |leap.opts.safe_labels| plus one.

    The list can either be defined as a string or a table. Setting it to `{}`
    or `''` forces autojump to always be on (except for Operator-pending mode,
    where it makes no sense). In this case, do not forget to set
    |leap.opts.special_keys.next_group| to something "safe" too.

A heuristic behind the default label lists: since the commands invoking the
motions are mapped to left-hand keys by default, we tend to prioritize
right-hand keys to get a better balance for the whole sequence on average.

                                                        *leap.opts.special_keys*
`special_keys =` >
    {
      next_target = '<enter>',
      prev_target = '<tab>',
      next_group = '<space>',
      prev_group = '<tab>',
    }

Meta-keys accepted at runtime:

*leap.opts.special_keys.next_target*   Repeat the previous search.
                                     |leap-traversal|: jump to the next target
*leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target*   |leap-traversal|: jump to the previous
                                     target.
*leap.opts.special_keys.next_group*    Shift to the next group of labeled targets.
*leap.opts.special_keys.prev_group*    Shift to the previous group of labeled
                                     targets.

Note: `<esc>` is hardcoded to exit Leap at any stage cleanly.

==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHTING                                                    *leap-highlight*

Leap uses the following highlight groups that you can configure to your own
liking (using |:hi| or |nvim_set_hl()|):

                                                                  *hl-LeapMatch*
LeapMatch
    Matches that can be reached without picking a label. By default, this
    group is only used for |leap-traversal|.

                                                           *hl-LeapLabelPrimary*
LeapLabelPrimary
    Target labels in the currently selected group.

                                                         *hl-LeapLabelSecondary*
LeapLabelSecondary
    Target labels in the group(s) beyond the currently selected one.

                                                               *hl-LeapBackdrop*
LeapBackdrop
    In some cases it might be useful to apply certain settings on the whole
    search area, like disabling certain |attr-list| attributes, or adding a
    uniform grey foreground color, to make labels easier to see. This group is
    not set by default.

In order to preserve your custom settings after changing the colorscheme, you
might want to wrap them in a function, and define an autocommand like below.
(Leap does the same, but with |:hi-default|, so it will not overwrite yours.)
>lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('ColorScheme', {
      callback = function ()
        if vim.g.colors_name == "this_colorscheme_needs_tweaking" then
          -- Force using the defaults of Leap:
          require('leap').init_highlight(true)
          -- And/or make your own tweaks:
          vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapBackdrop', { link = 'Comment' })
          -- etc.
        end
      end
    })

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                             *leap-events*

The |User| event is triggered with the following patterns on entering/exiting
Leap:

*LeapEnter*
*LeapLeave*

Example - turning off |hlsearch| while leaping: >lua

    do
      local saved_hls
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
        pattern = 'LeapEnter',
        callback = function ()
          saved_hls = vim.o.hlsearch
          vim.o.hlsearch = false
        end,
      })
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
        pattern = 'LeapLeave',
        callback = function () vim.o.hlsearch = saved_hls end,
      })
    end

The argument table passed to |leap.leap()| can be accessed at runtime via the
`state` table: `require('leap').state.args`.

Using `state.args`, you can customize practically anything on a per-call
basis. Keep in mind that nothing prevents you from passing arbitrary flags
when calling |leap.leap()|: >lua

    function custom_leap_func()
      require('leap').leap {
        is_custom_leap_func = true,
          -- ...
      }
    end

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      callback = function (event)
        if require('leap').state.args.is_custom_leap_func then
          -- Implement some special logic here, that will only apply to
          -- custom_leap_func(), and restore the state (if needed) in an
          -- analogous `LeapLeave` autocommand.
        end
      end
    })

==============================================================================
EXTENDING LEAP                                                 *leap-extensions*

There is more to Leap than meets the eye. On a general level, you should think
of it as less of a motion plugin and more of an engine for selecting visible
targets on the screen (acquired by arbitrary means), and doing arbitrary things
with them.

There are lots of ways you can extend the plugin and bend it to your will, and
the combinations of them give you almost infinite possibilities.

Instead of using the provided `<Plug>` keys (|leap-custom-mappings|), you can
also call the `leap()` function directly:

leap({opts})                                                       *leap.leap()*
    Entry point for all |leap.nvim| actions.

    Parameters: ~
        {opts} Optional parameters.
               • backward: Search backward instead of forward in the current
                 window.
               • target_windows: A list of windows (as |winid|s) to be
                 searched.
               • offset: Where to land with the cursor compared to the target
                 position (-1, 0, 1, 2).
               • inclusive_op: A flag indicating whether an operation should
                 behave as |inclusive|.
               • opts: A table just like |leap.opts|, to override any default
                 setting for the specific call. Example: >lua

                    `require('leap').leap { opts = { safe_labels = '' } }`
<
                                                           *leap-custom-targets*
               • targets: Either a list of targets, or a function returning
                 such a list. The advantage of the latter is that the function
                 will be evaluated after |LeapEnter| (that is, after setting
                 temporary editor options, etc.), so that you can even prompt
                 the user for input while already "in" Leap.
                 The elements of the list are tables of arbitrary structure,
                 with the only mandatory field being `pos` - a (1,1)-indexed
                 tuple; this is the position of the label, and also the jump
                 target, if there is no custom `action` provided. If you have
                 targets in multiple windows, you also need to provide a
                 `wininfo` field for each (|getwininfo()|). Targets can
                 represent anything with a position, like |treesitter| nodes,
                 etc.

               • action: A Lua function that will be executed by Leap in place
                 of the jump, taking the selected target as its argument. (You
                 could obviously implement some custom jump logic here too.)
