INTRODUCTION                                                 *leap-introduction*

Leap is a motion plugin that allows you to jump to any positions in the
visible editor area by entering a 2-character search pattern, and then
potentially a "label" character to pick your target from multiple matches,
similar to Justin M. Keyes' Sneak plugin. The novel idea in Leap is its
"clairvoyant" ability: you get a live preview of the target labels - by
mapping possible futures, Leap can show you which key(s) you will need to
press before you actually need to do that, resulting in a much more
frictionless experience.

Key mappings should be defined explicitly. To start using the plugin with the
default ones, call `require('leap').add_default_mappings()`.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                               *leap-usage*

- Initiate the search in the forward (`s`) or backward (`S`) direction, or in
  the other windows (`gs`).
- Start typing a 2-character pattern (`{c1}{c2}`).
- After typing the first character, you see "labels" appearing next to some of
  the `{c1}{?}` pairs. You cannot _use_ the labels yet.
- Enter `{c2}`. If the pair was not labeled, then voilà, you're already there.
  No need to be bothered by remaining labels, just continue editing.
- Else: select a label. In case of multiple groups, first switch to the desired
  one, using `<space>` (step back with `<tab>`, if needed).

                                   *leap-visual-mode* *leap-operator-pending-mode*
In Visual and Operator-pending mode, there are two different pairs of
directional motions available, providing the necessary additional comfort and
precision.

`s`/`S` are like their Normal-mode counterparts, except that `s` includes the
whole match in the selection/operation (which might be considered the more
intuitive behaviour for these modes).

On the other hand, `x`/`X` are like `t`/`T` for `f`/`F` - they exclude the
matched pair:

```
abcd|                    |bcde
████e  ←  Sab    sde  →  █████
ab██e  ←  Xab    xde  →  ███de
```

Note that each of the forward motions are |inclusive|, and |o_v| works as
expected on them.

                          *leap-targeting-end-of-line* *leap-targeting-empty-line*
A character at the end of a line can be targeted by pressing `<space>` after it.
There is no special mechanism behind this: you can set aliases for the
newline character simply by defining a set in |leap.opts.equivalence_classes|
that contains it. Empty lines can also be targeted, by pressing the newline
alias twice (`<space><space>` by default). This latter is a slightly more
magical feature, but fulfills the principle that any visible position you can
move to with the cursor should be reachable by Leap too.

                                                                   *leap-repeat*
Pressing `<enter>` after invoking any of Leap's motions sets the search
pattern to the previous one (`special_keys.repeat_search`).

                                                                *leap-traversal*
After entering at least one input character, `<enter>` initiates "traversal"
mode, moving on to the next match on each keypress
(`special_keys.next_phase_one_target` or `special_keys.next_target`).

`<tab>` can revert the previous jump(s) in case you accidentally overshoot
your target (`special_keys.prev_target`).

Tips:

- When repeating the previous search, you can immediately move on:
  `s|S <enter> <enter> ...`

- Accepting the first match after one input character is a useful shortcut in
  operator-pending mode (e.g. `ds{char}<enter>`).

- Traversal mode can be used as a substitute for normal-mode `f`/`t` motions.
  `s{char}<enter><enter>` is the same as `f{char};`, but works over multiple
  lines.

Note: If |leap.opts.safe_labels| is in use, the labels will remain available
during the whole time.

Note: For cross-window search, traversal mode is not supported (since there's
no direction to follow), but you can still accept the first (presumably only)
match with `<enter>`, even after one input.

                                                               *leap-dot-repeat*
You can repeat change and delete operations with the `.` character, if
repeat.vim (https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) is installed.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                            *leap-config* *leap.opts*

Below is the description of all configurable values in the `opts` table, with
their defaults.

Example configuration: >
    local leap = require('leap')
    leap.opts.case_sensitive = true
    leap.opts.substitute_chars = { ['\r'] = '¬' }
    leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target = { '<s-enter>', ',' }
<
Available options~

                                               *leap.opts.max_phase_one_targets*
`max_phase_one_targets = nil`

    By default, the plugin shows labels and/or highlights matches right after
    the first input character. This option disables ahead-of-time displaying
    of target beacons beyond a certain number of phase one targets (to
    mitigate visual noise in extreme cases). Setting it to 0 disables
    two-phase processing altogether.

                               *leap.opts.highlight_unlabeled_phase_one_targets*
`highlight_unlabeled_phase_one_targets = false`

    Whether to highlight all unlabeled matches in phase one. (Matches covering
    labels will get highlighted anyway.)

                                   *leap.opts.max_highlighted_traversal_targets*
`max_highlighted_traversal_targets = 10`

    Number of targets to be highlighted after the cursor in |leap-traversal|
    mode (when there are no labels at all).

                                                      *leap.opts.case_sensitive*
`case_sensitive = false`

    Whether to consider case in search patterns.

                                                 *leap.opts.equivalence_classes*
`equivalence_classes = { ' \t\r\n' }`

    A character will match any other in its equivalence class. The sets can
    either be defined as strings or tables.

    Example: >
    {
      '\r\n',
      ')]}>',
      '([{<',
      { '"', "'", '`' },
    }
<
    Note: Make sure to have a set containing `\n` if you want to be able to
    target characters at the end of the line.

    Note: Non-mutual aliases are not possible in Leap, for the same reason
    that supporting |smartcase| is not possible: we would need to show two
    different labels, corresponding to two different futures, at the same
    time.

                                                    *leap.opts.substitute_chars*
`substitute_chars = {}`

    The keys in this table will be substituted in labels and highlighted
    matches by the given characters. This way special (e.g. whitespace)
    characters can be made visible in matches, or even be used as labels.

    Example: `{ ['\r'] = '¬' }`

                                                         *leap.opts.safe_labels*
`safe_labels` >
    { "s", "f", "n", "u", "t", "/",
      "S", "F", "N", "L", "H", "M", "U", "G", "T", "?", "Z" }
<
    When the number of matches does not exceed the number of these "safe"
    labels plus one, the plugin jumps to the first match automatically after
    entering the pattern. Obviously, for this purpose you should choose keys
    that are unlikely to be used right after a jump!

    Setting the list to `{}` effectively disables the autojump feature.

    Note: Operator-pending mode ignores this, since we need to be able to
    select the actual target before executing the operation.

                                                              *leap.opts.labels*
`labels` >
    { "s", "f", "n",
      "j", "k", "l", "h", "o", "d", "w", "e", "m", "b",
      "u", "y", "v", "r", "g", "t", "c", "x", "/", "z",
      "S", "F", "N",
      "J", "K", "L", "H", "O", "D", "W", "E", "M", "B",
      "U", "Y", "V", "R", "G", "T", "C", "X", "?", "Z" }
<
    Target labels to be used when there are more matches than labels in
    |leap.opts.safe_labels| plus one.

    Setting the list to `{}` forces autojump to always be on (except for
    Operator-pending mode, where it makes no sense). In this case, do not
    forget to set `special_keys.next_group` to something "safe" too.

Heuristics behind the default label lists:
- Since the commands invoking the motions are mapped to left-hand keys by
  default, we tend to prioritize right-hand keys to get a better balance for
  the whole sequence on average.
- At least the first few labels should be the same on the two lists, since
  those become muscle memory, and might be used automatically, a bit like
  [count] values.

                                                        *leap.opts.special_keys*
`special_keys` >
    {
      repeat_search = '<enter>',
      next_phase_one_target = '<enter>',
      next_target = {'<enter>', ';'},
      prev_target = {'<tab>', ','},
      next_group = '<space>',
      prev_group = '<tab>',
      multi_accept = '<enter>',
      multi_revert = '<backspace>',
    }
<
    Keys captured by the plugin at runtime, to:
    - repeat with the previous input after invocation
    - jump to the next/previous match in traversal mode (|leap-traversal|)
    - switch to the next/previous group of matches, when there are more
      matches than available labels
    - accept the selection, and deselect the last selected target in
      |leap-multiselect| mode

==============================================================================
DEFAULT MAPPINGS                                         *leap-default-mappings*

The defaults can be set by calling `require('leap').add_default_mappings()`.

Note that the function will check for conflicts with any custom mappings
created by you or other plugins, and will not overwrite them, unless explicitly
told so (called with a `true` argument).

==============================================================================
CUSTOM MAPPINGS                                           *leap-custom-mappings*

<Plug> keys are aliases for right hand sides of mappings - in our case, calls
to |leap.leap()|. If you are not familiar with the concept, see |<Plug>| and
|using-<Plug>|.

Available <Plug> keys (with their corresponding argument tables):

*<Plug>(leap-forward-to)*
arguments: `{}` in Normal mode, otherwise `{ offset = +1, inclusive_op = true }`
default mapping: `s`

*<Plug>(leap-forward-till)*
arguments: `{ offset = -1, inclusive_op = true }`
default mapping: `x` (Visual and Operator-pending mode only)

*<Plug>(leap-backward-to)*
arguments: `{ backward = true }`
default mapping: `S`

*<Plug>(leap-backward-till)*
arguments: `{ backward = true, offset = 2 }`
default mapping: `X` (Visual and Operator-pending mode only)

*<Plug>(leap-from-window)*
arguments: `{ target_windows = require('leap.util').get_enterable_windows() }`
default mapping: `gs`

Example: `vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'f', '<Plug>(leap-forward-to)')`

For creating custom motions with behaviours different from the above, see
|leap.leap()|.

The keys for repeating the search, and for switching between groups of matches
can be set via |leap.opts.special_keys|.

==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHTING                                                    *leap-highlight*

Leap uses the following highlight groups that you can configure to your own
liking (using |:hi| or |nvim_set_hl()|):

                                                                  *hl-LeapMatch*
LeapMatch
    Matches that can be reached directly, without having to use a label. (By
    default, this group is only used for |leap-traversal|.)

                                                           *hl-LeapLabelPrimary*
LeapLabelPrimary
    The character needed to be pressed to jump to the match position, after
    the whole search pattern has been given. It appears once the first input
    has been entered, right next to the pair.

                                                         *hl-LeapLabelSecondary*
LeapLabelSecondary
    If the number of matches exceeds the available target labels, the next
    group of labels are shown with a different color. Those targets can be
    reached by pressing `<space>` (`special_keys.next_group`) before the label
    character.

                                                          *hl-LeapLabelSelected*
LeapLabelSelected
    Labels that are selected for the action in |leap-multiselect| mode.

                                                               *hl-LeapBackdrop*
LeapBackdrop
    In some cases it might be useful or even necessary to apply certain
    settings on the rest of the area, like disabling all `gui` attributes, or
    adding a uniform grey foreground color, to make Leap matches and labels
    more distinguishable. This group is not set by default.

Example: `vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapBackdrop', { fg = 'grey' })`

In order to preserve your custom settings after changing the colorscheme, you
might want to wrap them in a function, and define an autocommand like below.
(Leap does the same, but with |:hi-default|, so it will not overwrite yours.)
>
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('ColorScheme', {
      callback = function ()
        vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapMatch', { <def. map> })
        -- etc.
      end
    })

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                             *leap-events*

The |User| event is triggered with the following patterns on entering/exiting
Leap (not in traversal mode):

*LeapEnter*
*LeapLeave*

Example: >
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      command = 'nohlsearch',
    })
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapLeave',
      command = 'let &hlsearch=&hlsearch',
    })
<

EXTENDING LEAP                                                 *leap-extensions*

There is more to Leap than meets the eye. On a general level, you should think
of it as less of a motion plugin and more of an engine for selecting visible
targets on the screen (acquired by arbitrary means), and doing arbitrary things
with them.

There are lots of ways you can extend the plugin and bend it to your will, and
the combinations of them give you almost infinite possibilities.

Instead of using the provided `<Plug>` keys, you can also call the `leap()`
function directly:

leap({opts})                                                       *leap.leap()*
    Entry point for all |leap.nvim| actions.

    Parameters ~
        {opts} Optional parameters.
               • opts: A table just like |leap.opts|, to override any default
                 setting for the specific call.
                 E.g.: `require('leap').leap { opts = { labels = {} } }`
               • offset: Where to land with the cursor compared to the target
                 position (-1, 0, 1, 2).
               • inclusive_op: A flag indicating whether an operation should
                 behave as |inclusive|.
               • backward: Search backward instead of forward in the current
                 window.
               • target_windows: A list of windows (as |winid|s) to be
                 searched.
                                                           *leap-custom-targets*
               • targets: Either a list of targets, or a function returning
                 such a list. The advantage of the latter is that the function
                 will be evaluated after |LeapEnter| (that is, after setting
                 temporary editor options, etc.), so that you can even prompt
                 the user for input while already "in" Leap.
                 The elements of the list are tables of arbitrary structure,
                 with the only mandatory field being `pos` - a (1,1)-indexed
                 tuple; this is the position of the label, and also the jump
                 target, if there is no custom `action` provided. If you have
                 targets in multiple windows, you also need to provide a
                 `wininfo` field for each (|getwininfo()|). Targets can
                 represent anything with a position, like Tree-sitter nodes,
                 etc.
                                                            *leap-custom-action*
               • action: A Lua function that will be executed by Leap in place
                 of the jump. (You could obviously implement some custom jump
                 logic here too.) Its only argument is either a target, or a
                 list of targets (in multiselect mode).
                                                              *leap-multiselect*
               • multiselect: A flag allowing for selecting multiple targets
                 for `action`. In this mode, you can just start picking labels
                 one after the other. You can revert the most recent pick with
                 `<backspace>` (`special_keys.multi_revert`), and accept the
                 selection with `<enter>` (`special_keys.multi_accept`).

                                                  *leap.state* *leap-runtime-args*
Accessing the arguments passed to leap() ~

The arguments of the current call are always available at runtime, in the
`state.args` table.

Using |leap-events| together with the `args` table, you can customize practically
anything on a per-call basis. Keep in mind that you can even pass arbitrary
flags when calling |leap()|:
>
    function my_custom_leap_func()
        require'leap'.leap { my_custom_flag = true, ... }
    end

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      callback = function ()
        if require'leap'.state.args.my_custom_flag then
          -- Implement some special logic here, that will only apply to
          -- my_custom_leap_func() (e.g., change the style of the labels),
          -- and clean up with an analogous `LeapLeave` autocommand.
        end
      end
    })
