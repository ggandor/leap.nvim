INTRODUCTION                                                 *leap-introduction*

Leap is a motion plugin that allows you to jump to any positions in the
visible editor area by entering a 2-character search pattern, and then
potentially a "label" character to pick your target from multiple matches,
similar to Justin M. Keyes' Sneak plugin for Vim. The main novel idea in Leap
is that you get a live preview of the target labels - by mapping possible
futures, Leap can show you which key(s) you will need to press before you
actually need to do that, resulting in a much more frictionless experience.

Key mappings should be defined explicitly. To start using the plugin with the
default ones, call `require('leap').create_default_mappings()`.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                               *leap-usage*

- Initiate the search in the forward (`s`) or backward (`S`) direction, or in
  the other windows (`gs`).
- Start typing a 2-character pattern (`{c1}{c2}`).
- After typing the first character, you see "labels" appearing next to some of
  the `{c1}{?}` pairs. You cannot _use_ the labels yet.
- Enter `{c2}`. If the pair was not labeled, then voilà, you're already there.
  No need to be bothered by remaining labels, just continue editing.
- Else: type the label character. If there are too many matches (more than
  ~50), you might need to switch to the desired group first, using `<space>`
  (step back with `<tab>`, if needed).

A character at the end of a line can be targeted by pressing `<space>` after
it. There is no special mechanism behind this: `<space>` is simply an alias
for the newline character, defined in |leap.opts.equivalence_classes| by
default.

Empty lines or EOL positions can also be targeted, by pressing the newline
alias twice (`<space><space>`). This latter is a slightly more magical
feature, but fulfills the principle that any visible position you can move to
with the cursor should be reachable by Leap too.

                                                           *leap-smart-autojump*
Leap only jumps to the first match if the remaining matches can be covered by
a limited set of "safe" target labels (keys you would not use right after a
jump), but stays in place, and switches to an extended label set otherwise.
For fine-tuning or disabling this behaviour, see |leap.opts.labels| and
|leap.opts.safe_labels|.

                                                    *leap-traversal* *leap-repeat*
`<enter>` (|leap.opts.special_keys.next_target|) is a very special key: at any
stage, it initiates "traversal" mode, moving on to the next match on each
subsequent keypress. If you press it right after invoking a Leap motion (e.g.
`s<enter>`), it uses the previous search pattern. In case you accidentally
overshoot your target, `<tab>` (|leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target|) can
revert the jump(s).

You can make `next_target` and `prev_target` behave like like |;| and |,|,
that is, repeat the last motion without explicitly invoking Leap (see
|leap-repeat-keys|).

Traversal mode can be used as a substitute for `fFtT` motions.
`s{char}<enter><enter>` is the same as `f{char};`, or `ds{char}<enter>` as
`dt{char}`, but they work over multiple lines.

Note: In case of cross-window search (|leap_gs|), you cannot traverse (since
there's no direction to follow), but the search can be repeated, and you can
also accept the first (presumably only) match with `<enter>`, even after one
input.

Note: If |leap.opts.safe_labels| is in use, the labels will remain available
during the whole time.

                                                               *leap-dot-repeat*
Operations can be repeated with |.|, if repeat.vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) is installed.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                         *leap-mappings*

Default mappings ~
                                                         *leap-default-mappings*
The defaults can be set by calling
`require('leap').create_default_mappings()`.

Note that the function will check for conflicts with any custom mappings
created by you or other plugins, and will not overwrite them, unless called
with a `true` argument.

                                                        *leap_s*
s{char1}{char2}         Jump forward to a labeled or [count]'th visible
                        occurrence of {char1}{char2}. The cursor is placed on
                        {char1} |exclusive|.
                        To operate till the end of the line, use |o_v|, and
                        include the newline characer (aliased to `<space>` by
                        default in |leap.opts.equivalence_classes|) in the
                        input pattern: `{op}vs{char}{newline}`.

                                                        *leap_S*
S{char1}{char2}         Jump backward to a labeled or [count]'th visible
                        occurrence of {char1}{char2}. The cursor is placed on
                        {char1} |exclusive|.

                                                        *leap_gs*
gs{char1}{char2}        Jump to a labeled occurrence of {char1}{char2} in one
                        of the other windows on the tab page. The cursor is
                        placed on {char1} |exclusive|.

Custom mappings ~
                                                          *leap-custom-mappings*
<Plug> keys are aliases for right hand sides of mappings - in our case, calls
to |leap.leap()|. So simply use these strings as `rhs` in |vim.keymap.set()|:

`vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'f', '<Plug>(leap-forward)')`

*<Plug>(leap-forward)*
arguments: `{}`
default mapping: `s`

*<Plug>(leap-backward)*
arguments: `{ backward = true }`
default mapping: `S`

*<Plug>(leap-from-window)*
arguments: `{ target_windows = require('leap.util').get_enterable_windows() }`
default mapping: `gs`

Alternative set for in-window motions ("fFtT"-style, including or excluding
the whole 2-character match in Visual and Operator-pending-mode):

*<Plug>(leap-forward-to)*
arguments: `{}` in Normal mode, otherwise `{ offset = +1, inclusive_op = true }`
suggested mapping: `s`

*<Plug>(leap-backward-to)*
arguments: `{ backward = true }`
suggested mapping: `S`

*<Plug>(leap-forward-till)*
arguments: `{ offset = -1, inclusive_op = true }`
suggested mapping: `x` (for Visual and Operator-pending mode only)

*<Plug>(leap-backward-till)*
arguments: `{ backward = true, offset = 2 }`
suggested mapping: `X` (for Visual and Operator-pending mode only)

    abcd|                         |bcde
    -----------------------------------
    |bcde  ←  Sab    n    sde  →  abc|e
    ████e  ←  Sab  (v|o)  sde  →  █████
    ab██e  ←  Xab  (v|o)  xde  →  ███de

To create custom motions with behaviours different from the predefined ones,
see |leap.leap()|.

Setting repeat keys ~
                                                              *leap-repeat-keys*
There is also a convenience function that helps you set repeat keys that work
like `;` / `,` for `f` / `t`, that is, repeat the last motion without
explicitly invoking Leap (after that, they enter |leap-traversal| mode, and
behave as |leap.opts.special_keys.next_target| and
|leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target|):
>
    require('leap').add_repeat_mappings(';', ',', {
      -- False by default. If set to true, the keys will work like the
      -- native semicolon/comma, i.e., forward/backward is understood in
      -- relation to the last motion.
      relative_directions = true,
      -- By default, all modes are included.
      modes = {'n', 'x', 'o'},
    })

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                            *leap-config* *leap.opts*

Below is the description of all configurable values in the `opts` table, with
their defaults.

Example configuration: >
    local leap = require('leap')
    leap.opts.case_sensitive = true
    leap.opts.substitute_chars = { ['\r'] = '¬' }
    leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target = '<s-enter>'
<
Available options~

                                               *leap.opts.max_phase_one_targets*
`max_phase_one_targets = nil`

    Disable ahead-of-time displaying of target beacons beyond a certain number
    of phase one targets (to mitigate visual noise in extreme cases). Setting
    this option to 0 disables two-phase processing altogether.

                               *leap.opts.highlight_unlabeled_phase_one_targets*
`highlight_unlabeled_phase_one_targets = false`

    Highlight unlabeled (i.e., directly reachable) matches after the first
    input character.

                                   *leap.opts.max_highlighted_traversal_targets*
`max_highlighted_traversal_targets = 10`

    Number of targets to be highlighted after the cursor in |leap-traversal|
    mode, if there are no labels used.

                                                      *leap.opts.case_sensitive*
`case_sensitive = false`

    Consider case in search patterns.

                                                 *leap.opts.equivalence_classes*
`equivalence_classes = { ' \t\r\n' }`

    A character in search patterns will match any other in its equivalence
    class. The sets can either be defined as strings or tables.

    Example: `{ ' \t\r\n', ')]}', '([{', '\'"' }`

    Note: Make sure to have a set containing `\n` if you want to be able to
    target characters at the end of the line.

    Note: Non-mutual aliases are not possible in Leap, for the same reason
    that supporting |smartcase| is not possible: we would need to show two
    different labels, corresponding to two different futures, at the same
    time.

                                                    *leap.opts.substitute_chars*
`substitute_chars = {}`

    The keys in this table will be substituted in labels and highlighted
    matches by the given characters. This way special (e.g. whitespace)
    characters can be made visible in matches, or even be used as labels.

    Example: `{ ['\r'] = '¬' }`

                                                         *leap.opts.safe_labels*
`safe_labels = 'sfnut/SFNLHMUGTZ?'`

    When the number of matches does not exceed the number of these "safe"
    labels plus one, the plugin jumps to the first match automatically after
    entering the pattern. Obviously, for this purpose you should choose keys
    that are unlikely to be used right after a jump!

    The list can either be defined as a string or a table. Setting it to `{}`
    or `''` effectively disables the autojump feature.

    Note: Operator-pending mode ignores this, since we need to be able to
    select the actual target before executing the operation.

                                                              *leap.opts.labels*
`labels = 'sfnjklhodweimbuyvrgtaqpcxz/SFNJKLHODWEIMBUYVRGTAQPCXZ?'`

    Target labels to be used when there are more matches than labels in
    |leap.opts.safe_labels| plus one.

    The list can either be defined as a string or a table. Setting it to `{}`
    or `''` forces autojump to always be on (except for Operator-pending mode,
    where it makes no sense). In this case, do not forget to set
    |leap.opts.special_keys.next_group| to something "safe" too.

A heuristic behind the default label lists: since the commands invoking the
motions are mapped to left-hand keys by default, we tend to prioritize
right-hand keys to get a better balance for the whole sequence on average.

                                                        *leap.opts.special_keys*
`special_keys =` >
    {
      next_target = '<enter>',
      prev_target = '<tab>',
      next_group = '<space>',
      prev_group = '<tab>',
      multi_accept = '<enter>',
      multi_revert = '<backspace>',
    }
<
Meta-keys accepted at runtime:

*leap.opts.special_keys.next_target*   Repeat the previous search.
                                     |leap-traversal|: jump to the next target
*leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target*   |leap-traversal|: jump to the previous
                                     target.
*leap.opts.special_keys.next_group*    Shift to the next group of labeled targets.
*leap.opts.special_keys.prev_group*    Shift to the previous group of labeled
                                     targets.
*leap.opts.special_keys.multi_accept*  |leap-multiselect|: accept the selection.
*leap.opts.special_keys.multi_revert*  |leap-multiselect|: deselect the last
                                     selected target

Note: `<esc>` is hardcoded to exit Leap at any stage cleanly.

==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHTING                                                    *leap-highlight*

Leap uses the following highlight groups that you can configure to your own
liking (using |:hi| or |nvim_set_hl()|):

                                                                  *hl-LeapMatch*
LeapMatch
    Matches that can be reached directly, without having to use a label. (By
    default, this group is only used for |leap-traversal|.)

                                                           *hl-LeapLabelPrimary*
LeapLabelPrimary
    The character needed to be pressed to jump to the match position, after
    the whole search pattern has been given. It appears once the first input
    has been entered, right next to the pair.

                                                         *hl-LeapLabelSecondary*
LeapLabelSecondary
    If the number of matches exceeds the available target labels, the next
    group of labels are shown with a different color. Those targets can be
    reached by pressing `<space>` (|leap.opts.special_keys.next_group|) before
    the label character.

                                                          *hl-LeapLabelSelected*
LeapLabelSelected
    Labels that are selected for the action in |leap-multiselect| mode.

                                                               *hl-LeapBackdrop*
LeapBackdrop
    In some cases it might be useful or even necessary to apply certain
    settings on the rest of the area, like disabling all `gui` attributes, or
    adding a uniform grey foreground color, to make Leap matches and labels
    more distinguishable. This group is not set by default.

Example: `vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapBackdrop', { fg = 'grey' })`

In order to preserve your custom settings after changing the colorscheme, you
might want to wrap them in a function, and define an autocommand like below.
(Leap does the same, but with |:hi-default|, so it will not overwrite yours.)
>
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('ColorScheme', {
      callback = function ()
        vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapMatch', { <def. map> })
        -- etc.
      end
    })

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                             *leap-events*

The |User| event is triggered with the following patterns on entering/exiting
Leap (not in traversal mode):

*LeapEnter*
*LeapLeave*

Example: >
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      command = 'nohlsearch',
    })
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapLeave',
      command = 'let &hlsearch=&hlsearch',
    })

EXTENDING LEAP                                                 *leap-extensions*

There is more to Leap than meets the eye. On a general level, you should think
of it as less of a motion plugin and more of an engine for selecting visible
targets on the screen (acquired by arbitrary means), and doing arbitrary things
with them.

There are lots of ways you can extend the plugin and bend it to your will, and
the combinations of them give you almost infinite possibilities.

Instead of using the provided `<Plug>` keys, you can also call the `leap()`
function directly:

leap({opts})                                                       *leap.leap()*
    Entry point for all |leap.nvim| actions.

    Parameters ~
        {opts} Optional parameters.
               • opts: A table just like |leap.opts|, to override any default
                 setting for the specific call.
                 E.g.: `require('leap').leap { opts = { labels = {} } }`
               • offset: Where to land with the cursor compared to the target
                 position (-1, 0, 1, 2).
               • inclusive_op: A flag indicating whether an operation should
                 behave as |inclusive|.
               • backward: Search backward instead of forward in the current
                 window.
               • target_windows: A list of windows (as |winid|s) to be
                 searched.
                                                           *leap-custom-targets*
               • targets: Either a list of targets, or a function returning
                 such a list. The advantage of the latter is that the function
                 will be evaluated after |LeapEnter| (that is, after setting
                 temporary editor options, etc.), so that you can even prompt
                 the user for input while already "in" Leap.
                 The elements of the list are tables of arbitrary structure,
                 with the only mandatory field being `pos` - a (1,1)-indexed
                 tuple; this is the position of the label, and also the jump
                 target, if there is no custom `action` provided. If you have
                 targets in multiple windows, you also need to provide a
                 `wininfo` field for each (|getwininfo()|). Targets can
                 represent anything with a position, like Tree-sitter nodes,
                 etc.
                                                            *leap-custom-action*
               • action: A Lua function that will be executed by Leap in place
                 of the jump. (You could obviously implement some custom jump
                 logic here too.) Its only argument is either a target, or a
                 list of targets (in multiselect mode).
                                                              *leap-multiselect*
               • multiselect: A flag allowing for selecting multiple targets
                 for `action`. In this mode, you can just start picking labels
                 one after the other. You can revert the most recent pick with
                 `<backspace>` (`special_keys.multi_revert`), and accept the
                 selection with `<enter>` (`special_keys.multi_accept`).

                                                  *leap.state* *leap-runtime-args*
Accessing the arguments passed to leap() ~

The arguments of the current call are always available at runtime, in the
`state.args` table.

Using |leap-events| together with the `args` table, you can customize practically
anything on a per-call basis. Keep in mind that you can even pass arbitrary
flags when calling |leap()|:
>
    function my_custom_leap_func()
        require'leap'.leap { my_custom_flag = true, ... }
    end

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      callback = function ()
