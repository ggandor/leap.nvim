INTRODUCTION                                  *leap* *leap.nvim* *leap-introduction*

Leap is a motion plugin that allows you to jump to any position in the visible
editor area by entering a 2-character search pattern, and then potentially a
label character to pick your target from multiple matches, similar to
vim-sneak (https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak). The main novel idea in Leap
is that you get a preview of the target labels - you can see which key you
will need to press before you actually need to do that, resulting in a
smoother overall experience.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                               *leap-usage*

Note: Key mappings should be defined explicitly. To start using the plugin
with the default ones, call `require('leap').set_default_mappings()`. For
custom mappings and arrangements, see |leap-custom-mappings|.

• Initiate the search in the current window (`s`), or in the other windows
  (`S`).
• Start typing a 2-character pattern ({char1}{char2}).
• After typing the first character, you see "labels" appearing next to some of
  the {char1}{?} pairs. You cannot use them yet - they only get active after
  finishing the pattern. *leap-preview*
• Enter {char2}. If the pair was not labeled, you automatically jump there.
  You can safely ignore the remaining labels, and continue editing - those are
  guaranteed non-conflicting letters, disappearing on the next keypress
  (|leap.opts.safe_labels|). *leap-autojump*
• Else: type the label character, that is now active. If there are more
  matches than available labels, you can switch between groups, using <space>
  and <backspace> (|leap.opts.keys|).

If a |language-mapping| ('keymap') is active, Leap waits for keymapped
sequences as needed and searches for the keymapped result as expected.

Special positions

The last character on a line can be targeted by pressing <space> after it.
There is nothing special going on here: <space> is simply an alias for `\n`
and `\r`, set in |leap.opts.equivalence_classes| by default. *leap-till-eol*

To target actual EOL positions, including empty lines, press the newline alias
twice (pretend that each newline character is duplicated).
*leap-to-eol* *leap-to-empty-line*

Target ordering                                           *leap-target-ordering*

When searching bidirectionally, Leap sorts matches by Euclidean (beeline)
distance from the cursor, but the current line you're on, and on that line,
forward direction is prioritized. That is, you can be sure that the targets
right in front of you will be the first ones.

Smart autojump                                             *leap-smart-autojump*

|leap-autojump| is only triggered if the remaining matches can be covered by a
set of "safe" target labels (keys never used right after leaping), otherwise
the cursor stays put, and an extended label set is loaded. To fine-tune or
disable this behaviour, see |leap.opts.safe_labels| and |leap.opts.labels|.

Repeat and traversal                                     *leap-repeat-traversal*

At any stage, <enter> (|leap.opts.keys.next_target|) jumps to the next/closest
available target: `s<enter>` repeats the previous search; `s{char}<enter>` can
be used as a multiline substitute for `fFtT` motions. *leap-partial-input*

In case of directional search, <enter> can continue traversing through the
rest of the targets (`s<enter><enter>...`). If you overshoot, <backspace>
(|leap.opts.keys.prev_target|) steps back.

There is a convenience function in the `user` module to set keys to repeat the
previous search without explicitly invoking Leap (similar to using |;| or
|,|). It makes sense to use `next_target` and `prev_target`, for maximum
consistency: >lua
    require('leap.user').set_repeat_keys('<enter>', '<backspace>', {
      -- If set to true, the keys will work like the native
      -- semicolon/comma, i.e., forward/backward is understood in
      -- relation to the last motion.
      relative_directions = false,
      modes = {'n', 'x', 'o'},
    })
<
In case of bidirectional search, invoking repeat right away like above might
substitute for the lack of direct traversal ability.

Dot-repeat                                                     *leap-dot-repeat*

Operations can be repeated with |.|, if repeat.vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) is installed. Dot-repeat works as you
would expect, e.g., if you aimed for the 2nd target backwards, `.` will do the
same (the "beeline" |leap-target-ordering| is ignored).

Concealed labels                                         *leap-concealed-labels*

Labels in subsequent target groups are concealed with an empty block or a
middle dot, depending on the color scheme, and have a dimmed color.
(See also: |leap.init_hl()|).
                                                        *leap-preview-conflicts*
In |leap-preview| phase, certain labels might be concealed in the first group
too, marking that there is a conflict or potential source of confusion (to be
resolved in the next step):

1. Two overlapping matches at window edge or EOL, where at least one of them
   is labeled. (A label beyond the edge would be shifted left a column, so
   there is no way to know which match is the owner.)
2. A label on top of another, unlabeled match. When typing quickly, this is
   in any case unsafe and unacceptable.

MAPPINGS                                                         *leap-mappings*

To set the defaults, call `require('leap').set_default_mappings()`.

                                                        *leap_s* *leap_v_s*
                                                        *leap_o_s*
s{char1}{char2}         Jump to an occurrence of {char1}{char2} in the current
                        window. The cursor is placed on {char1} |exclusive|.
                        To operate till the end of the line, use |o_v|, and
                        finish the pattern with a newline alias, e.g.
                        `yvs{char}<space>`. |leap.opts.equivalence_classes|

                                                        *leap_S*
S{char1}{char2}         Jump to an occurrence of {char1}{char2} in one of the
                        other windows on the tab page. The cursor is placed on
                        {char1}. Works only in Normal mode.

==============================================================================
CUSTOM MAPPINGS                                            *leap-custom-mappings*

Leap defines <Plug> keys aliasing calls to |leap.leap()|. To create custom
motions, simply call that function with your preferred arguments instead.
E.g., `<Plug>(leap-backward)` is just a synonym for: >lua
    function () require('leap').leap { backward = true } end

Available <Plug> keys ~

    Key                         |  Search scope    |  Offset  |  |inclusive|
    ----------------------------|------------------|----------|-------------
    *<Plug>(leap)*                |  Current window  |          |
    *<Plug>(leap-from-window)*    |  Other windows   |          |
    *<Plug>(leap-anywhere)*       |  All windows     |          |
    *<Plug>(leap-forward)*        |  After cursor    |          |
    *<Plug>(leap-forward-to)*     |  After cursor    |          |  true
    *<Plug>(leap-forward-till)*   |  After cursor    |  -1      |  true
    *<Plug>(leap-backward)*       |  Before cursor   |          |
    *<Plug>(leap-backward-to)*    |  Before cursor   |          |
    *<Plug>(leap-backward-till)*  |  Before cursor   |  +1      |

Suggested arrangements ~

1. Default: >lua

    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's', '<Plug>(leap)')
    vim.keymap.set('n',             'S', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')

2. Jump to anywhere in Normal mode with one key: >lua

    vim.keymap.set('n',        's', '<Plug>(leap-anywhere)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'}, 's', '<Plug>(leap)')

Trade-off: if you have multiple windows open on the tab page, you will almost
never get |leap-autojump|, except if all targets are in the same window.
(This is an intentional restriction: it would be too disorienting if the
cursor could jump in/to a different window than your goal, right before
selecting the target.)

3. Sneak-style: >lua

    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's',  '<Plug>(leap-forward)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'S',  '<Plug>(leap-backward)')
    vim.keymap.set('n',             'gs', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')

4. F/t-style: >lua

    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's',  '<Plug>(leap-forward-to)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'S',  '<Plug>(leap-backward-to)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'},      'x',  '<Plug>(leap-forward-till)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'},      'X',  '<Plug>(leap-backward-till)')
    vim.keymap.set('n',             'gs', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')

Note: Same-character sequences (`aaa...`) are matched at one position only: if
`offset` in |leap.leap()| is positive, at the end, otherwise at the start.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                            *leap-config* *leap.opts*

Below is the description of all configurable values in the `opts` table, with
their defaults.

Example configuration: >lua
    local leap = require('leap')
    leap.opts.case_sensitive = true
    leap.opts.keys.prev_target = '<s-enter>'
<
                                                      *leap.opts.case_sensitive*
`case_sensitive = false`

    Consider case in search patterns.

                                                 *leap.opts.equivalence_classes*
`equivalence_classes = { ' \t\r\n' }`

    A character in search patterns will match any other in its equivalence
    class. The sets can either be defined as strings or tables.
    Example - whitespace, brackets, and quotes: >lua
        { ' \t\r\n', '([{', ')]}', '\'"`' }
<
    Note: If you want to be able to target empty lines and characters at the
    end of a line, keep an alias for `\n` and `\r`. |leap-till-eol|

    Note: Wildcard characters (non-mutual aliases) are not possible in Leap,
    for the same reason that supporting |smartcase| is not possible: we cannot
    read your mind, and decide on which label to show for |leap-preview|.
    (Generally: having any `*` -> `x|y|z` mapping, after pressing `a`, we
    either label an `ax` match as an item in the `a(x|y|z)` match list -
    pressing `*` next -, or the potentially smaller `ax` list - pressing `x`
    next -, and there is no way to know which one to choose.)

                                                      *leap.opts.preview_filter*
`preview_filter = nil`

    A function that only lets through selected matches for |leap-preview|, to
    reduce visual noise. It gets three characters as arguments: the character
    preceding the match (might be an empty string) and the matched pair
    itself. Examples: >lua

    -- Disable preview altogether.
    function () return false end

    -- Exclude whitespace and the middle of alphabetic words from preview:
    --   foobar[baaz] = quux
    --   ^----^^^--^^-^-^--^
    function (ch0, ch1, ch2)
      return not (
        ch1:match('%s') or
        ch0:match('%a') and ch1:match('%a') and ch2:match('%a')
      )
    end
<
    You can implement more involved checks here (camel case, keywords, you
    name it), but keep in mind that this function will be called for every
    single match, so efficiency is something to consider.

                                                         *leap.opts.safe_labels*
`safe_labels = 'sfnut/SFNLHMUGTZ?'`

    These should be keys that you never use right after leaping (e.g. a search
    command), so that we can trigger |leap-autojump| whenever this list covers
    the rest of the matches. Any other key "falls through" to Normal mode.

    Can be a string or a table. Setting it to `''` or `{}` effectively
    disables the autojump feature.

    Note: Operator-pending mode ignores this, and tries to use
    |leap.opts.labels|, since we should select the final target right away.

                                                              *leap.opts.labels*
`labels = 'sfnjklhodweimbuyvrgtaqpcxz/SFNJKLHODWEIMBUYVRGTAQPCXZ?'`

    Target labels to be used when there are more matches than
    |leap.opts.safe_labels| plus one.

    Can be a string or a table. Setting it to `''` or `{}` forces
    |leap-autojump| to always be on. In that case, do not forget to set
    |leap.opts.keys.next_group| to something "safe" too.

A heuristic behind the default label lists: since the commands invoking the
motions are mapped to left-hand keys by default, we tend to prioritize
right-hand keys to get a better balance for the whole sequence on average.

                                                                *leap.opts.keys*
`keys =` >
    {
      next_target = '<enter>',
      prev_target = '<backspace>',
      next_group = '<space>',
      prev_group = '<backspace>',
    }

*leap.opts.keys.next_target*
Jump to the next available target (use the previous search pattern if no input
has been given). |leap-repeat-traversal|

*leap.opts.keys.prev_target*
Jump to the previous target (revert `next_target`).

*leap.opts.keys.next_group*
Shift to the next group of labeled targets.

*leap.opts.keys.prev_group*
Shift to the previous group of labeled targets (revert `next_group`).

Each value can be a table too, with alternatives. In `next_target` and
`prev_target`, subsequent keys only get active once we have the full search
pattern (no more input characters are needed). Example ("clever-s"):
>lua
    local keys = require('leap').opts.keys
    keys.next_target = { '<enter>', 's' }
    keys.prev_target = { '<backspace>', 'S' }
<
Note: <esc> is hardcoded to exit Leap at any stage cleanly.

                                                            *leap.opts.vim_opts*
`vim_opts =` >
    {
      ['wo.scrolloff'] = 0,
      ['wo.sidescrolloff'] = 0,
      ['wo.conceallevel'] = 0,
      ['bo.modeline'] = false,
    }

Temporary |options| to be set on |LeapEnter|, and restored to their original
value upon |LeapLeave|. The keys should follow the above pattern, the prefix
corresponding to |vim.wo|, |vim.bo|, or |vim.go|.

Example - turning off |hlsearch| while leaping: >lua
    require('leap').opts.vim_opts['go.hlsearch'] = false
<
==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHTING                                                    *leap-highlight*

Leap uses the following highlight groups that you can configure to your own
liking (using |:hi| or |nvim_set_hl()|):

                                                                  *hl-LeapLabel*
LeapLabel		Target labels. |hi-link|ed to |hl-IncSearch| by default.
                        Note: When set manually (not loaded as part of a color
                        scheme), you should call |leap.init_hl()| afterwards,
                        to update the look of |leap-concealed-labels|, derived
                        from this group.

                                                                  *hl-LeapMatch*
LeapMatch		Search matches when doing |leap-traversal| without
                        labels. Linked to |hl-Search| by default.
                        To disable match highlights: >lua
                            vim.cmd 'highlight! link LeapMatch None'
<
                                                               *hl-LeapBackdrop*
LeapBackdrop		In some cases it might be useful to apply certain
                        settings on the whole search area, like disabling
                        certain |attr-list| attributes, or linking to
                        `Comment`, to make labels easier to see. This group is
                        not set by default.

To preserve your custom settings, wrap them in a function, and define an
autocommand for |ColorScheme|: >lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('ColorScheme', {
      callback = function ()
        -- Color-scheme-specific settings
        if vim.g.colors_name == 'foo' then
          -- Force using the defaults of Leap for this scheme.
          require('leap').init_hl(true)
        elseif vim.g.colors_name == 'bar' then
          vim.cmd 'hi! link LeapLabel Substitute'
        end
        -- General settings
        vim.cmd 'hi! link LeapMatch None'
        -- Call this last, to ensure updating concealed labels.
        require('leap').init_hl()
      end
    })
<
leap.init_hl({force})                                           *leap.init_hl()*
    Sets the highlight groups to their defaults (without `force`, only as
    fallback). It also updates the look of |leap-concealed-labels|, based on
    the actual settings of |hl-LeapLabel|. Automatically called the first time
    Leap is loaded, and then on |ColorScheme| events.

    Parameters: ~
      • {force}  (boolean) optional: defaults to false. Set the groups without
                 |hi-default|.

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                             *leap-events*

The |User| event is triggered with the following patterns on entering/exiting
Leap:

*LeapEnter*
*LeapLeave*

The argument table passed to |leap.leap()| can be accessed at runtime via
`require('leap').state.args`. This lets you customize anything on a per-call
basis - just set a flag when calling |leap.leap()|: >lua

    local function leap2 ()
      require('leap').leap {
        called_leap2 = true,
        -- other arguments...
      }
    end

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      callback = function (event)
        if require('leap').state.args.called_leap2 then
          -- Put some special logic here, that will only apply to leap2().
          -- You can do cleanup in an analogous LeapLeave autocommand.
        end
      end
    })

EXTENDING LEAP                                                 *leap-extensions*

There is more to Leap than meets the eye. On a general level, you should think
of it as less of a motion plugin and more of an engine for selecting visible
targets on the screen (acquired by arbitrary means), and doing arbitrary things
with them.

There are lots of ways you can extend the plugin and bend it to your will, and
the combinations of them give you almost infinite possibilities.

Instead of using the provided <Plug> keys (|leap-custom-mappings|), you can
also call `leap()` directly:

leap({opts})                                                       *leap.leap()*
    Entry point for all |leap.nvim| actions.

    Parameters: ~
        {opts} Optional parameters.
               • backward: Search backward instead of forward in the current
                 window.
               • target_windows: A list of windows (as |winid|s) to be
                 searched.
               • offset: Where to land with the cursor compared to the target
                 position (-1, 0, 1).
               • inclusive_op: A flag indicating whether an operation should
                 behave as |inclusive|.
               • opts: A table just like |leap.opts|, to override any default
                 setting for the specific call. Example: >lua
                    require('leap').leap {
                      opts = { safe_labels = '' }
                    }
<
                 For map-like subtables it is also enough to specify only the
                 values to be overridden: >lua
                    require('leap').leap {
                      opts = { vim_opts = { ['go.hlsearch'] = false } }
                    }
<
                                                                       *leap-ft*
               • inputlen: Set to 1 for |f|-like motions. See an example of a
                 full setup in the README. Note: This feature is experimental,
                 subject to change or removal.
                                                           *leap-custom-pattern*
               • pattern: a |regexp| pattern, to be consumed by |search()|.
                 Keep in mind that you need to escape backslashes in the Lua
                 string, as you want to pass them literally to the Vim
                 function! See an example in the README. Note: This feature is
                 experimental, subject to change or removal.
                                                           *leap-custom-targets*
               • targets: Either a list of targets, or a function returning
                 such a list. The advantage of the latter is that the function
                 will be evaluated after |LeapEnter| (that is, after setting
                 temporary editor options, etc.), so that you can even prompt
                 the user for input while already "in" Leap.
                 The elements of the list are tables of arbitrary structure,
                 with the only mandatory field being `pos` - a (1,1)-indexed
                 tuple; this is the position of the label, and also the jump
                 target, if there is no custom `action` provided. If you have
                 targets in multiple windows, you also need to provide a
                 `wininfo` field for each (|getwininfo()|). Targets can
                 represent anything with a position, like |treesitter| nodes,
                 etc.
                                                            *leap-custom-action*
               • action: A Lua function that will be executed by Leap in place
                 of the jump, taking the selected target as its argument. (You
                 could obviously implement some custom jump logic here too.)
