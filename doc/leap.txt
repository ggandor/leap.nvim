INTRODUCTION                                  *leap* *leap.nvim* *leap-introduction*

Leap is a motion plugin that allows you to jump to any position in the visible
editor area by entering a 2-character search pattern, and then potentially a
label character to pick your target from multiple matches, similar to
vim-sneak (https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak). The main novel idea in Leap
is that you get a preview of the target labels - Leap shows you which key you
will need to press before you actually need to do that, resulting in a
smoother overall experience.

Key mappings should be defined explicitly. To start using the plugin with the
default ones, call `require('leap').create_default_mappings()`.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                               *leap-usage*

• Initiate the search in the forward (`s`) or backward (`S`) direction, or in
  the other windows (`gs`). (For different arrangements, see
  |leap-custom-mappings|.)

• Start typing a 2-character pattern (`{char1}{char2}`).

• After typing the first character, you see "labels" appearing next to some of
  the `{char1}{?}` pairs. You cannot use the labels yet. *leap-preview*

• Enter `{char2}`. If the pair was not labeled, then voilà, you're already
  there. You can safely ignore the remaining labels, and continue editing -
  those are guaranteed non-conflicting letters, disappearing on the next
  keypress (|leap.opts.safe_labels|). *leap-autojump*

• Else: type the label character. If there are more matches than available
  labels, you can switch between groups, using `<space>` and `<tab>`.

If a |language-mapping| ('keymap') is active, Leap waits for keymapped
sequences as needed and searches for the keymapped result as expected.

                                                           *leap-to-end-of-line*
A character at the end of a line can be targeted by pressing `<space>` after
it. Note that there is no special mechanism behind this: `<space>` is simply
an alias for `\n` and `\r`, set in |leap.opts.equivalence_classes| by default.

A slightly more magical feature is that you can target actual EOL positions,
including empty lines, by pressing the newline alias twice (`<space><space>`).
This fulfills the principle that any visible position you can move to with the
cursor should be reachable by Leap too.

                                                           *leap-smart-autojump*
Leap only jumps to the first match if the remaining matches can be covered by
a limited set of "safe" target labels (keys you would not use right after a
jump), but stays in place, and switches to an extended label set otherwise.
For fine-tuning or disabling this behaviour, see |leap.opts.labels| and
|leap.opts.safe_labels|.

                                                    *leap-repeat* *leap-traversal*
At any stage (after 0, 1, or 2 input characters), `<enter>`
(|leap.opts.special_keys.next_target|) consistently jumps to the first
available target. Pressing it right after invocation (`s<enter>`) repeats the
previous search. Pressing it after one input character (`s{char}<enter>`) can
be used as a multiline substitute for `fFtT` motions.

If the search is directional, `<enter>` can also traverse through the rest of
the targets, moving on to the next one on each subsequent keypress
(`s<enter><enter>...`). If you overshoot, `<tab>`
(|leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target|) can revert the jump(s).

There is a convenience function in the `user` module to set keys that behave
like |;| and |,|, that is, repeat the last motion without explicitly invoking
Leap (after that, they enter traversal mode, and behave as you would expect).
It makes sense to use `next_target` and `prev_target`, for maximum
consistency: >lua

    require('leap.user').set_repeat_keys('<enter>', '<backspace>', {
      -- False by default. If set to true, the keys will work like the
      -- native semicolon/comma, i.e., forward/backward is understood in
      -- relation to the last motion.
      relative_directions = true,
      -- By default, all modes are included.
      modes = {'n', 'x', 'o'},
    })
<
                                                               *leap-dot-repeat*
Operations can be repeated with |.|, if repeat.vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) is installed.

                                                         *leap-concealed-labels*
In |leap-preview| phase, some labels might be concealed with an empty block or
a middle dot, depending on the colorscheme. Those mark that there is some kind
of conflict or potential source of confusion, that will only be resolved after
entering the second input character:

    A. The label is on top of another label.
    B. The label is on top of an unlabeled match.
    C. The label immediately follows an unlabeled match.
    D. The label is not active yet (the match is in a subsequent group). In
       this case we still need to signal that this a labeled match (do not
       expect |leap-autojump|).

Case A and C are possible when the match is right next to EOL or the window
edge, and the label is shifted left, displayed over the second character.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                         *leap-mappings*

To set the defaults, call `require('leap').create_default_mappings()`.

                                                        *leap_s*
s{char1}{char2}         Jump forward to a labeled or [count]'th visible
                        occurrence of {char1}{char2}. The cursor is placed on
                        {char1} |exclusive|.
                        To operate till the end of the line, use |o_v|, and
                        finish the pattern with a newline alias, e.g.
                        `yvs{char}<space>`. |leap.opts.equivalence_classes|

                                                        *leap_S*
S{char1}{char2}         Jump backward to a labeled or [count]'th visible
                        occurrence of {char1}{char2}. The cursor is placed on
                        {char1} |exclusive|.

                                                        *leap_gs*
gs{char1}{char2}        Jump to a labeled occurrence of {char1}{char2} in one
                        of the other windows on the tab page. The cursor is
                        placed on {char1} |exclusive|.

==============================================================================
CUSTOM MAPPINGS                                            *leap-custom-mappings*

Leap defines <Plug> keys aliasing calls to |leap.leap()|. To create custom
motions different from the predefined ones, simply call the function with your
preferred arguments instead. E.g., `<Plug>(leap-backward)` is a synonym for:
>lua
    function () require('leap').leap { backward = true } end

Available <Plug> keys ~

    Key                         |  Search scope   | Offset | |inclusive|
    ----------------------------|-----------------|--------|------------
    *<Plug>(leap-forward)*        |  After cursor   |        |
    *<Plug>(leap-forward-to)*     |  After cursor   | +1 (*) | true
    *<Plug>(leap-forward-till)*   |  After cursor   | -1     | true
    *<Plug>(leap-backward)*       |  Before cursor  |        |
    *<Plug>(leap-backward-to)*    |  Before cursor  |        |
    *<Plug>(leap-backward-till)*  |  Before cursor  | +2     |
    *<Plug>(leap)*                |  Current window |        |
    *<Plug>(leap-from-window)*    |  Other windows  |        |

(*) Only in Visual and Operator-pending mode.

Note: `<Plug>(leap)` sorts matches by euclidean distance from the cursor, with
the exception that the current line, and on the current line, forward
direction is prioritized. That is, you can always be sure that the targets
right in front of you will be the first ones.

Suggested arrangements ~

Default: >lua

    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's',  '<Plug>(leap-forward)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'S',  '<Plug>(leap-backward)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'gs', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')

Bidirectional search in the current window: >lua

    vim.keymap.set('n',        's', '<Plug>(leap)')
    vim.keymap.set('n',        'S', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'}, 's', '<Plug>(leap-forward)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'}, 'S', '<Plug>(leap-backward)')

Mapping to `<Plug>(leap)` is not recommended for Visual mode, as autojumping
in a random direction might be too disorienting with the selection highlight
on, and neither for Operator-pending mode, as |leap-dot-repeat| cannot be used
if the search is non-directional.

Note that compared to using separate keys for the two directions, you will get
twice as many targets and thus half as many |leap-autojump|s on average, but
not needing to press the Shift key for backward motions might compensate for
that. Another caveat is that you cannot traverse through the matches
(|leap-traversal|), although invoking repeat right away (|leap-repeat|) can
substitute for that.

Evil-snipe-style (https://github.com/hlissner/evil-snipe): >lua

    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 's',  '<Plug>(leap-forward-to)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'S',  '<Plug>(leap-backward-to)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'},      'x',  '<Plug>(leap-forward-till)')
    vim.keymap.set({'x', 'o'},      'X',  '<Plug>(leap-backward-till)')
    vim.keymap.set({'n', 'x', 'o'}, 'gs', '<Plug>(leap-from-window)')

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                            *leap-config* *leap.opts*

Below is the description of all configurable values in the `opts` table, with
their defaults.

Example configuration: >lua
    local leap = require('leap')
    leap.opts.case_sensitive = true
    leap.opts.substitute_chars = { ['\r'] = '¬' }
    leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target = '<s-enter>'
<
                                                      *leap.opts.case_sensitive*
`case_sensitive = false`

    Consider case in search patterns.

                                                 *leap.opts.equivalence_classes*
`equivalence_classes = { ' \t\r\n' }`

    A character in search patterns will match any other in its equivalence
    class. The sets can either be defined as strings or tables.

    Example - whitespace, brackets, and quotes: >lua
        { ' \t\r\n', '([{', ')]}', '\'"`' }
<
    Note: If you want to be able to target empty lines, and characters at the
    end of a line, make sure to keep an alias for `\n` and `\r`.
    |leap-to-end-of-line|

    Note: Wildcard characters (non-mutual aliases) are not possible in Leap,
    for the same reason that supporting |smartcase| is not possible: we cannot
    read your mind, and decide on which label to show for |leap-preview|.
    (Generally: having a `?` -> `[bc]` mapping, after pressing `a`, we either
    label an `ab` match as part of the `ab` subset of matches - corresponding
    to pressing `b` next -, or the potentially bigger `a[bc]` subset -
    corresponding to pressing `?` next, the wildcard.)

                                                      *leap.opts.preview_filter*
`preview_filter = nil`

    [EXPERIMENTAL]
    A function that only lets through selected matches for |leap-preview|, to
    reduce visual noise. It gets three characters as arguments: the character
    preceding the match (might be an empty string) and the matched pair
    itself. Examples: >lua

    -- Skip the pair if it begins with whitespace or mid-word alphanumeric
    -- character: foobar[quux]
    --            ^    ^^^  ^^
    function (ch0, ch1, ch2)
      return not (
        ch1:match('%s') or
        ch0:match('%w') and ch1:match('%w') and ch2:match('%w')
      )
    end

    -- Disable preview altogether.
    function () return false end
<
                                   *leap.opts.max_highlighted_traversal_targets*
`max_highlighted_traversal_targets = 10`

    Number of targets to be highlighted after the cursor in |leap-traversal|
    mode, if there are no labels used.

                                                    *leap.opts.substitute_chars*
`substitute_chars = {}`

    The keys in this table will be substituted in labels and highlighted
    matches by the given characters. This way special (e.g. whitespace)
    characters can be made visible in matches, or even be used as labels.

    Example: `{ ['\r'] = '¬' }`

                                                         *leap.opts.safe_labels*
`safe_labels = 'sfnut/SFNLHMUGTZ?'`

    These should be keys that you would never use right after a jump, so that
    the plugin can instantly jump to the first match when this safe list
    covers the rest. Any other key than these "falls through" to Normal mode.
    This removes a step in the common case: you don't need to explicitly exit,
    just type your next command. |leap-autojump|

    The list can either be defined as a string or a table. Setting it to `{}`
    or `''` effectively disables the autojump feature.

    Note: Operator-pending mode ignores this, and tries to use
    |leap.opts.labels|, since we need to be able to select the actual target
    before executing the operation anyway.

                                                              *leap.opts.labels*
`labels = 'sfnjklhodweimbuyvrgtaqpcxz/SFNJKLHODWEIMBUYVRGTAQPCXZ?'`

    Target labels to be used when there are more matches than
    |leap.opts.safe_labels| plus one.

    The list can either be defined as a string or a table. Setting it to `{}`
    or `''` forces autojump to always be on (except for Operator-pending mode,
    where it makes no sense). In this case, do not forget to set
    |leap.opts.special_keys.next_group| to something "safe" too.

A heuristic behind the default label lists: since the commands invoking the
motions are mapped to left-hand keys by default, we tend to prioritize
right-hand keys to get a better balance for the whole sequence on average.

                                                        *leap.opts.special_keys*
`special_keys =` >
    {
      next_target = '<enter>',
      prev_target = '<tab>',
      next_group = '<space>',
      prev_group = '<tab>',
    }

Meta-keys accepted at runtime. Each one can be a table too, with a list of
alternatives.

*leap.opts.special_keys.next_target*
Jump to the next available target (use the previous search pattern if no input
has been given). |leap-traversal|

*leap.opts.special_keys.prev_target*
Jump to the previous target (revert `next_target`).

*leap.opts.special_keys.next_group*
Shift to the next group of labeled targets.

*leap.opts.special_keys.prev_group*
Shift to the previous group of labeled targets (revert `next_group`).

Note: `<esc>` is hardcoded to exit Leap at any stage cleanly.

==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHTING                                                    *leap-highlight*

Leap uses the following highlight groups that you can configure to your own
liking (using |:hi| or |nvim_set_hl()|):

                                                                  *hl-LeapMatch*
LeapMatch
    Search matches. By default, this group is only used for |leap-traversal|.

                                                                  *hl-LeapLabel*
LeapLabel
    Target labels.

                                                               *hl-LeapBackdrop*
LeapBackdrop
    In some cases it might be useful to apply certain settings on the whole
    search area, like disabling certain |attr-list| attributes, or adding a
    uniform grey foreground color, to make labels easier to see. This group is
    not set by default.

To preserve your custom settings, wrap them in a function, and define an
autocommand for |ColorScheme| change: >lua

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('ColorScheme', {
      callback = function ()
        if vim.g.colors_name == "this_colorscheme_needs_tweaking" then
          -- Force using the defaults of Leap:
          require('leap').init_highlight(true)
          -- And/or make your own tweaks:
          vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'LeapBackdrop', { link = 'Comment' })
          -- etc.
        end
      end
    })

==============================================================================
EVENTS                                                             *leap-events*

The |User| event is triggered with the following patterns on entering/exiting
Leap:

*LeapEnter*
*LeapLeave*

Example - turning off |hlsearch| while leaping: >lua

    do
      local saved_hls
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
        pattern = 'LeapEnter',
        callback = function ()
          saved_hls = vim.o.hlsearch
          vim.o.hlsearch = false
        end,
      })
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
        pattern = 'LeapLeave',
        callback = function () vim.o.hlsearch = saved_hls end,
      })
    end

The argument table passed to |leap.leap()| can be accessed at runtime via
`require('leap').state.args`. This lets you customize anything on a per-call
basis - just set a flag when calling |leap.leap()|: >lua

    local function my_leap_func()
      require('leap').leap {
        my_leap_func = true,
        -- other arguments...
      }
    end

    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
      pattern = 'LeapEnter',
      callback = function (event)
        if require('leap').state.args.my_leap_func then
          -- Implement some special logic here, that will only apply to
          -- my_leap_func(), and restore the state (if needed) in an
          -- analogous `LeapLeave` autocommand.
        end
      end
    })

==============================================================================
EXTENDING LEAP                                                 *leap-extensions*

There is more to Leap than meets the eye. On a general level, you should think
of it as less of a motion plugin and more of an engine for selecting visible
targets on the screen (acquired by arbitrary means), and doing arbitrary things
with them.

There are lots of ways you can extend the plugin and bend it to your will, and
the combinations of them give you almost infinite possibilities.

Instead of using the provided `<Plug>` keys (|leap-custom-mappings|), you can
also call the `leap()` function directly:

leap({opts})                                                       *leap.leap()*
    Entry point for all |leap.nvim| actions.

    Parameters: ~
        {opts} Optional parameters.
               • backward: Search backward instead of forward in the current
                 window.
               • target_windows: A list of windows (as |winid|s) to be
                 searched.
               • offset: Where to land with the cursor compared to the target
                 position (-1, 0, 1, 2).
               • inclusive_op: A flag indicating whether an operation should
                 behave as |inclusive|.
               • opts: A table just like |leap.opts|, to override any default
                 setting for the specific call. Example: >lua

                    require('leap').leap { opts = { safe_labels = '' } }
<
                                                            *leap-custom-action*
               • action: A Lua function that will be executed by Leap in place
                 of the jump, taking the selected target as its argument. (You
                 could obviously implement some custom jump logic here too.)
                                                           *leap-custom-targets*
               • targets: Either a list of targets, or a function returning
                 such a list. The advantage of the latter is that the function
                 will be evaluated after |LeapEnter| (that is, after setting
                 temporary editor options, etc.), so that you can even prompt
                 the user for input while already "in" Leap.
                 The elements of the list are tables of arbitrary structure,
                 with the only mandatory field being `pos` - a (1,1)-indexed
                 tuple; this is the position of the label, and also the jump
                 target, if there is no custom `action` provided. If you have
                 targets in multiple windows, you also need to provide a
                 `wininfo` field for each (|getwininfo()|). Targets can
                 represent anything with a position, like |treesitter| nodes,
                 etc.
